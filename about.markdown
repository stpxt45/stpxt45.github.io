    I currently work in SF as a Research Engineer at <a href='https://www.createanything.com' target='_blank'>Anything</a>. Previously, I worked at Citadel Securities in New York. I went to the University of Waterloo a long time ago.

    I am mostly interested in the *correctness* of software. At Citadel Securities, this meant building many simulation (end to end) tests, and simulation frameworks which allowed us to replay lots and lots of historical data into an application. At Anything, I've focused on building evaluations for our AI agents, measuring automatic refactoring correctness, fullstack capabilities, and design quality.
