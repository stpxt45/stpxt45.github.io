    Formerly an Energy and Climate Consultant at <a href='https://www.rdh.com' target='_blank'>RDH Building Science</a>. Worked in building enclosure consulting out of undergrad as well as construction management, 'classical' civil engineering (roads, public works and municipal infrastructure) through many internships. University of Waterloo '18 (B.A.Sc Civil Engineering) and Kungliga Tekniska högskolan (KTH) '22 (M.Sc Civil and Architectural Engineering).

    I have been passionate about the built environment for as long as I could remember. I strive to make contributions in my lifetime towards addressing the climate emergcency. As the construction and operation of buildings account for 30-40% of carbon emisssions (depending on who you ask and where), my career trajectory has been at the intersection between these two interests. My undergraduate studies were focused on structural engineering and building science. During my master's studies, I focused more on architectural engineering topics such as energy efficiency and building services, thermal comfort, daylighting, and smart buildings. My graduate research focused on the use of machine learning on building management system data to predict occupancy patterns to inform more energy efficient building operations, such as reduced cases of overventilation.

    I am currently on a mini-retirement since mid-2025. I made this page to share random side projects I'm working on out of personal interest, related to the built environment and AI. Here is an AI froggy.
